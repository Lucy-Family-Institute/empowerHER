# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Before you Get Started:

1. Create a new folder on your computer to house this project. I named mine 'empowerHER'

2. Download the following:
   'Visual Studio Code': https://code.visualstudio.com/download
   'Android Studio': https://developer.android.com/studio 

3. Open VS Code and open a new terminal (CTRL ` )
      Once you open a new terminal, check that you are in the right folder, type 'ls' on the command line and it will show you all the folders. Find the folder you want this project to be in and navigate to that folder. To navigate, type 'cd' and then the name of the folder in the command line. If you accidently go into the wrong folder, just type 'cd ..' into the command line.

4. to clone this repo into your folder, type 'git clone [repo-URL]' in your command line
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lucy-Family-Institute/empowerHER
   ```

5. It will automatically send you into the main branch. DO NOT WORK ON THE MAIN BRANCH. Instead, type 'git checkout -b < new branch name >'. I recommend making your branch name your last name and the year you're graduating. You can make as many branches as you want, so if you mess up in one branch and can't figure out how to fix it, just make a new one.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <new branch name>
   ```

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
